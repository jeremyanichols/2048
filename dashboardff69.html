At no additional charge, stakefish validators participate in MAX MEV Smoothing Pool, which leverages the major MEV Relays to maximize each block rewards. All the rewards are fed to smoothing contract, and are available to be collected from our dashboard: \u003ca href=\"https://stake.fish/dashboard\"\u003ehttps://stake.fish/dashboard\u003c/a\u003e.

Most non-custodial staking services like ours require the full 32 ETH for each validator. If you would like to stake with less than 32 ETH, you may want to look into staking pools. You can also consider running your own validator."},{"header":"Can I stake ETH using my Ledger on any platform?","content":"At the moment, it is only possible to use a Ledger Nano X or Nano S to stake on Ethereum 2.0.\n      \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n      Staking Ethereum from your Ledger is a simple process.
